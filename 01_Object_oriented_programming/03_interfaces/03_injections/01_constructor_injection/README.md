# 🚀 Constructor Injection in Dependency Injection

## 📚 What is Constructor Injection?

Constructor Injection is a pattern in **Dependency Injection** (DI) where dependencies (or services) are provided to a class via its constructor rather than creating them inside the class. This makes the class easier to test and maintain by decoupling it from its dependencies.

### 🔑 Key Benefits:
- **Decoupling**: The class doesn't create its own dependencies.
- **Testability**: Easier to mock or substitute dependencies in unit tests.
- **Clear dependencies**: Dependencies are explicit and required, ensuring the class has everything it needs to function.

## 🔧 How Constructor Injection Works

In **constructor injection**, the required dependencies are passed directly through the class's constructor. 

Here's the basic flow:
1. The class declares its dependencies as constructor parameters.
2. When creating the class instance, the dependencies are passed in.

## 🛠 Example in Code

### 🚗 Simple Example (Java)

```java
class Engine {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Engine started!");
    }
}

class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    // Constructor Injection
    public Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }

    public void drive() {
        engine.start();
        System.out.println("Car is driving!");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Dependency injection via constructor
        Engine engine = new Engine();
        Car car = new Car(engine);
        car.drive();
    }
}
```

### 🐍 Python Example

```python
class Engine:
    def start(self):
        print("Engine started!")

class Car:
    def __init__(self, engine: Engine):
        self.engine = engine

    def drive(self):
        self.engine.start()
        print("Car is driving!")

# Dependency Injection via Constructor
engine = Engine()
car = Car(engine)
car.drive()
```

## 📍 Points to Remember

1. **Constructor vs. Setter Injection**: Constructor injection is more suitable when a class absolutely needs its dependencies. Setter injection is more flexible but less explicit.
2. **Immutable Dependencies**: Dependencies passed through the constructor are typically immutable (can't be changed after instantiation).
3. **Testability**: Constructor injection makes unit testing easier because dependencies can be mocked or replaced in tests.

---

## 💡 When to Use Constructor Injection?
- When a class **requires** certain dependencies to function.
- When you want to ensure all required dependencies are available at the time of object creation.
- For **easy unit testing** and **mocking** of dependencies.

---

## ⚡ Summary

Constructor injection is a simple, clean, and powerful way to manage dependencies in your code. It enhances testability, improves maintainability, and ensures that your classes are always properly initialized with the necessary components.
