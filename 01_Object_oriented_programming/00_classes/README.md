## 📝 Introduction

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm where everything is treated as objects. A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects, and an **object** is an instance of a class.

## 🏗️ What is a Class?

A **class** is a template or blueprint that defines the properties and behaviors that objects created from it will have. It contains:
- **Attributes**: Characteristics or data that the object will have.
- **Methods**: Functions or actions that the object can perform.

Think of a class as a recipe. It tells you how to make an object, but it doesn't make it itself.

## 🏎️ What is an Object?

An **object** is an instance of a class. When you create an object, you're using the class as a template to generate a specific entity with its own unique data.

For example, if the class is a "Car," then an object could be a specific car like a "2020 Toyota Corolla." Each object created from the class can have different data, but all objects will share the same structure and behaviors defined by the class.

## 🔨 Creating Objects from Classes

Once a class is defined, you can create as many objects as needed. Each object is an instance of the class, and you can interact with it using the attributes and methods defined in the class.

For instance, you can create multiple "Car" objects, each with its own make, model, and year, but they will all have the ability to perform actions like displaying information about the car.

## 🛠️ What are Methods?

A **method** is a function that is defined inside a class and is used to define the behavior or actions of the objects created from that class. Methods operate on the data contained within the object and can perform various tasks like modifying the object’s attributes or performing calculations.

Methods are essentially the actions or capabilities that an object can perform. For example:
- A "Car" class might have a method called `start_engine()`, which makes the car start.
- A "Dog" class might have a method called `bark()`, which makes the dog bark.

Methods allow objects to interact with their internal data and the outside world. They are defined using functions inside the class and are accessed by objects of that class.

This guide provides an overview of how classes serve as blueprints for creating objects in OOP, with an explanation of how methods define the actions objects can perform.
