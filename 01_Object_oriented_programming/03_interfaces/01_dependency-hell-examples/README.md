## 📌 Introduction
Tightly coupled code is a design pattern where components or modules depend heavily on each other, making modifications difficult and reducing maintainability.

## 🔍 What is Tightly Coupled Code?
In tightly coupled code, the components are highly interdependent, meaning changes in one component require modifications in others. This reduces flexibility and increases the risk of unintended side effects.

## ⚠️ Disadvantages of Tightly Coupled Code
- ❌ **Difficult to Modify** Changes in one part of the system require changes in other dependent parts.
- ❌ **Hard to Test** Unit testing becomes challenging due to dependencies.
- ❌ **Reduced Reusability** Components cannot be easily reused in different projects.
- ❌ **Poor Maintainability** Maintenance becomes complex and costly over time.
- ❌ **Scalability Issues** Adapting to new requirements or scaling the application is difficult.

## 🛠️ Example of Tightly Coupled Code
```python
class Engine:
    def start(self):
        print("Engine started")

class Car:
    def __init__(self):
        self.engine = Engine()  # Direct dependency
    
    def drive(self):
        self.engine.start()
        print("Car is moving")

car = Car()
car.drive()
```
### 🚨 Problems in the above code:
- The `Car` class is **directly dependent** on the `Engine` class.
- If we want to change the engine type, we need to modify the `Car` class.
- Cannot replace `Engine` with a different implementation (e.g., `ElectricEngine`).

## 💡 How to Avoid Tight Coupling
- ✔ **Use Dependency Injection** Pass dependencies instead of creating them inside a class.
- ✔ **Follow Interface-Based Design** Use abstraction to define contracts between classes.
- ✔ **Apply Design Patterns** Patterns like Factory, Strategy, and Observer can help reduce coupling.
- ✔ **Use Inversion of Control (IoC)** Let a higher-level module manage dependencies.

## 📌 Key Takeaways
- ✔ Tightly coupled code reduces flexibility, reusability, and maintainability.
- ✔ Decoupling code improves testability, scalability, and maintainability.
- ✔ Dependency Injection and Design Patterns help achieve loose coupling.
