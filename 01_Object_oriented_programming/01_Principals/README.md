# 🚀 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code using objects and classes, promoting efficiency, modularity, and reusability. This repository covers the four fundamental principles of OOP with explanations and folder links for each.

## 🔒 Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) within a class while restricting direct access to some components to maintain control and security.

### 🔹 Key Benefits:
- Prevents direct modification of critical data
- Enhances security by restricting access to internal states
- Encourages modular and maintainable code

## 🔄 Inheritance
Inheritance allows a class (child) to acquire properties and behaviors from another class (parent), promoting code reusability and hierarchical relationships.

### 🔹 Key Benefits:
- Reduces code duplication
- Establishes relationships between classes
- Allows extension and modification of base class functionality

## 🎭 Polymorphism
Polymorphism enables a single method, function, or operator to work in different ways depending on the object that is invoking it, promoting flexibility and scalability.

### 🔹 Key Benefits:
- Supports method overloading and overriding
- Increases flexibility by allowing different implementations
- Enables dynamic behavior in object-oriented systems

## 🧩 Abstraction
Abstraction focuses on exposing only essential functionalities while hiding implementation details, simplifying complex systems and reducing unnecessary complexity.

### 🔹 Key Benefits:
- Hides implementation details from the user
- Reduces complexity and increases code readability
- Improves maintainability by separating concerns
